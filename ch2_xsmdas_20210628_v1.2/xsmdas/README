This is Data Analysis Software for Solar X-ray Monitor(XSM) instrument 
on-board Chandrayaan-2 Mission by ISRO. This distribution of XSMDAS includes
modules for generation of calibrated level-2 data products such as spectrum 
and light curves from the XSM raw level-1 data sets.   

Pre-requisites
    OS: 64-bit Linux/Unix (CentOS 7.0+, Ubuntu 14.04+, RHEL 6.5+, Fedora 20+, 
					SLED 11.0+, OS X 10.13+)
    Compiler: gcc 4.4+
	For python tools, python3 and relvant modules


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Unzip the installation package ch2_xsmdas_yyyymmdd_vn.mm.zip to desired directory:

   unzip ch2_xsmdas_yyyymmdd_vn.mm.zip
   
   The top level directory is named xsmdas

2. Setting Environment variables: 

   Add following lines to ~/.bashrc
   
    export xsmdas= <path to xsmdas directory>/xsmdas
    export PATH="$xsmdas/bin:$xsmdas/scripts:$PATH"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$xsmdas/lib/":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PFILES="$PFILES:$xsmdas/pfiles"

   where <path to xsmdas directory> to be replaced with the absolute 
   path under which xsmdas directory resides. 

   source ~/.bashrc file as:

   . ~/.bashrc

   If the user has installed any other package that uses PIL with PFILES
   environment defined in ~/.bashrc, make sure that the other declaration 
   are appending the pfile paths to the environment variable.

   If the user has HEASOFT installation, it is recommended that the command
   to source the initialization script of HEASOFT, commonly aliased as heainit,
   if included in ~/.bashrc shall be after the above commands. This will create 
   a local copy of Parameter files under $HOME/pfiles.  

3. Installation of libraries:
   
   cd $xsmdas
   ./InstallLibs

   This will compile cfitsio and pil libraries from source.

4. Installation of CALDB:
   
   Download the caldb zip file provided along with XSMDAS. Unzip the 
   package ch2_xsm_caldb_yyyymmdd.zip to $xsmdas directory

   unzip ch2_xsm_caldb_yyyymmdd.zip -d $xsmdas  
   
   The caldb files will be extracted to $xsmdas/caldb directory.
    
5. Compilation:

   Once the libraries are installed compile XSMDAS with

   cd $xsmdas
   make 

   This will generate executables under $xsmdas/bin and completes the installation.

User manual

To view help for a task         : xsmhelp taskName

List of XSMDAS tasks
--------------------

* xsmgtigen     : Creates Good Time Intervals based on parameters ranges from a filterfile

* xsmgenspec    : Generates spectrum from Level-1 science data with required parameters

* xsmgenlc      : Generates light curve with required parameters

* xsmaddspec    : Addes multiple spectrum files together

Usage
-----

To execute a given module interactively, invoke the module in terminal and
provide the prompted input parameters. Instead of providing the input
parameters interactively, user can provide them as arguments of the
for parameterName = parameterValue. For eg.

xsmaddspec listfile=input_speclist.dat specfile=added_spec.pha

Complete list of parameters for each module are listed in the respective
help pages. Note that each module has a set of required parameters which
the user will be prompted to provide in interactive mode and a set of
optional hidden parameters. Hidden parameters are shown in square brackets
[] in the help files and will assume default values if not set. These
parameters can be set by the user only as command line arguments.

Loading XSM data in OSPEX/SSW
-----------------------------

Refer $xsmdas/idl/README_OSPEX_XSM

Additional useful python tools
------------------------------

Three python scripts are provided under $xsmdas/scripts. 

* xsmmet2utc: Convert XSM Mission Elapse Time(MET) to UTC String
* xsmutc2met: Convert UTC string to XSM MET 
* xsmcomputeflux: Compute broadband X-ray flux in the required energy range
   				  from time-resolved XSM spectra

For help type moduleName -h (eg. xsmmet2utc -h)
